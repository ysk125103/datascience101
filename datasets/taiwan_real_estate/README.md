## Taiwan Real Estate Valuation Dataset

Please check the original, full dataset [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Real+estate+valuation+data+set).

The file __taiwan_real_estate_partial.csv__ contains only 3 numerical features (inputs) and the label (output). The features have significantly different scales. 

Features: 
* __age__: the age of the house in years
* __station_distance__: distance to the closest train station
* __stores_count__: the number of convenience stores within walking distance

Label: 
* __unit_price__: house price per unit area

This partial dataset is ideal to learn about numerical features. 

Moreover, the feature __station_distance__ contains outliers. So you can use this dataset to study techniques for handling outliers.
